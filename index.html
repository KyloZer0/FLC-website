                <p>In 2012, our founder Bishop Dag Heward-Mills was led by the Holy Spirit to begin a new denomination which he called the First Love Church. In a small chapel on the University of Ghana, Legon Campus, he gathered a few students and began a small church.</p>

               <p>A few years down the line, Pastor Joshua, with the blessing of his father, started a new branch of First Love Church in East Legon where the headquarters stands today.</p>

                <p>A few years later, God has increased us into one of the largest churches in our city. With over 10,000 members and in our new state of the art auditorium, we are even more determined to see the name of Jesus lifted in the city of Accra.
                           <br>
                    Today, thousands of young people gather at our services because we believe that everyone 
                    is welcome into the house of God. In a place where soul-winning is our passion, we have seen countless lives changed, saved and renewed in our church.
                           <br>
                    Join us for a life changing encounter with the Word of God, Worship and the Holy Spirit.
                    A Sunday at the First Love Center is more than just a church service, it’s an experience!</p>
